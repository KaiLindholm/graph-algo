Requires python3
Problem 1
`python findMinX.py` will run with a random list of numbers and output the numbers less than the x defined. 
Problem 2
`python bunnyHop.py <n>` will print the number of paths for the input n 

`python bunnyHop.py test <n>` will run and output the algorithms duration and the count for n 1 -> n 

Problem 3
`python cricketHop.py` will run for the first 10 hops a cricket can make and print out the probability 

Problem 4 
`python heap.py <input file> <output file>` will take in an input file with numbers on each line, and output the sorted list to the output file 

`python heap.py` takes no arguments and runs the sorting with a random selection of 10 numbers
